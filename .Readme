# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up MongoDB, running the Node.js server, and testing the APIs in Postman.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
- Postman (or any other API testing tool) installed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZubairBasharat/node-js-assignment.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Setting up MongoDB

1. **Install MongoDB:**
   - Follow the official MongoDB installation guide for your operating system: [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
2. **Start MongoDB:**
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     mongod
     ```

## Running the Node.js Server

1. **Set environment variables (optional):**
   - If your application requires environment variables, create a `.env` file in the project root and add the necessary variables.
2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Testing the APIs in Postman

1. **Open Postman:**
2. **Import the collection (optional):**
   - If you have a Postman collection file, import it into Postman.
3. **Make API requests:**
   - Use the appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and endpoints for your APIs.
   - Provide necessary headers and request body data as required by the API documentation.
   - Observe the response received in Postman.

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you encounter any issues, refer to the application's error logs for more details.
- Ensure that MongoDB is running correctly and accessible to the Node.js server.
- Double-check API endpoints and request data for accuracy.

**Additional Notes:**

- Provide any specific instructions for your application, such as creating a database or user in MongoDB.
- Include links to relevant documentation or resources for further assistance.
